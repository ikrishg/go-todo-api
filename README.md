## 📖 Introduction

This is a simple REST API for a Todo application. It supports retrieval, creation, modification and deletion of Todos.

It is written in Go and uses the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework. I was trying to learn Go and this is my first project in Go.

## 📦 Built With

- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

There is no public deployment; run the API locally or with Docker.

You need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=<MongoDB Connection String>
DATABASE_NAME=<MongoDB Database Name>
```

Or you can set the environment variables directly.

Make sure that the MongoDB database is running and the connection string is correct. The database needs to have a collection named `Todos`.

### 🐳 Using Docker

The easiest way to get started is to use Docker. You can pull the image from Dockerhub and run it using the following commands:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env ikrishg/go-todo-api
```

### 🛠️ Building From Source

You can also build the API from source. You need to have Go installed on your system. You can then clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
go mod download
go mod verify
chmod +x ./scripts/build.sh
APP_NAME=go-todo-api ./scripts/build.sh
./bin/go-todo-api
```

## 📚 API Documentation
